## Business requirements

Mrs. Rose sells drinks. It offers several types of them. Its sale consists in the fact that every morning it goes to specific companies in a given city and offers its products to its employees. Unfortunately, Rose asks herself every morning how many, to whom and what products she will sell. The companies he goes to are the same every day. Help Rose and create a web application thanks to which:

- The day before employees of companies will be able to determine whether they want to buy something the next day (what drinks, quantity).

- Ms. Rose will see in the morning how much, what and in what company they want her drinks. Ms. Rose does not need precise information about the employee. Her employee's name and company location are enough. The most important information for her is how many minimum drinks of a given type should be taken in order to optimize sales.

- Ms. Rose will be able to post a message informing about her absence on a given day (e.g. due to illness).

Employees are not obliged to use the system. Therefore, Ms. Rose will visit all companies every day and ask her employees about the purchase.
